## Description of DSL

A graph, in this DSL, is an object of type `Graph`, taking a list of one 
or more

+ attributes
+ nodes
+ edges

described as tuples.

The implementations of `Node` and `Edge` provided in `dot_dsl.py`.

Observe the test cases in `dot_dsl_test.py` to understand the DSL's design.
