# Anagram

Given a word and a list of possible anagrams, select the correct sublist.

Given `"listen"` and a list of candidates like `"enlists" "google"
"inlets" "banana"` the program should return a list containing
`"inlets"`.

### Submitting Exercises

Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure the solution is in the `exercism/python/<exerciseName>` directory.

For example, if you're submitting `bob.py` for the Bob exercise, the submit command would be something like `exercism submit <path_to_exercism_dir>/python/bob/bob.py`.


For more detailed information about running tests, code style and linting,
please see the [help page](http://exercism.io/languages/python).
