# Python Exercises

This repository contains the exercises from https://github.com/exercism/python
providing small and well-defined problems complete with tests and solutions.

The excercises are mostly unchanged, this repo exists only to make using them
as straightforward as possible. You don't need to install anything other than Python.

## Get started

1. Browse through the folders and read the description until you find an
   exercise you like to solve. Let's say you select `hello-world`.
2. Clone the repository
    ```
    git clone git@github.com:Alexander-N/python-exercises.git
    ```
    Alternatively you can download the code from
    https://github.com/Alexander-N/python-exercises/archive/master.zip

3. Change into the directory of your exercise
   ```
   cd python-exercises/hello-world
   ```
4. Edit `hello_world.py` to solve the exercise. Look at README.md and test.py
   to find out what to do.
5. Run the tests with
   ```
   python3 test.py
   ```
   It is also possible to run a specific test, e.g.
   ```
   python3 test.py HelloWorldTests.test_hello
   ```
5. Compare your solution to the one in `solution.py`
6. You can make a pull request to share your solution.
