# Python Exercises

This repository contains the exercises from https://github.com/exercism/python
providing small and well-defined problems complete with tests and solutions.
The excercises are mostly unchanged, this repo exists only to make using them
as straightforward as possible. You don't need to install anything other than
Python.

## Choosing an exercise

To help you select an exercise you can use this [list](difficulties.md) where
they are ordered by approximate difficulty. Just browse through the exercises
and read the descriptions until you find a problem which interests you.

## Get started

* Clone the repository
    ```
    git clone git@github.com:Alexander-N/python-exercises.git
    ```
    Alternatively you can download the code from
    https://github.com/Alexander-N/python-exercises/archive/master.zip

* Let's say you select `hello-world`. Change into the directory of your exercise
   ```
   cd python-exercises/exercises/hello-world
   ```
* Edit `hello_world.py` to solve the exercise. Look at README.md and test.py
   to find out what to do.
* Run the tests with
   ```
   python3 test.py
   ```
   It is also possible to run a specific test, e.g.
   ```
   python3 test.py HelloWorldTests.test_hello
   ```
* Compare your solution to the one in `solution.py`
* You can make a pull request to share your solution.
