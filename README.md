# Python Exercises

This repository contains the exercises from https://github.com/exercism/python
providing small and well-defined problems complete with tests and solutions.

The excercises are mostly unchanged, this repo exists only to make using them as
straightforward as possible.

## Get started

1. Browse through the folders and read the description until you find an
exercise you like to solve. Let's say you select `hello-world`.
2. Clone the repository
    ```
    git clone git@github.com:Alexander-N/python-exercises.git
    ```
3. Change into the directory of your exercise
    ```
    cd python-exercises/hello-world
    ```
4. Edit `hello_world.py` until you think you have solved the exercise
5. Check your solution by running the tests
    ```
    python3 test.py
    ```
    It is also possible to run one test at a time, e.g.
    ```
    python3 test.py HelloWorldTests.test_hello
    ```
5. You can compare your solution to the one in `solution.py`
